# Personal Budget Dashboard Using R Language

## Project Overview

The **Personal Budget Dashboard** project aims to help individuals track and manage their finances by providing an interactive dashboard built using R. It allows users to input income, expenses, and categorize them to monitor monthly budget trends. The dashboard visualizes spending habits, highlights areas for improvement, and tracks financial goals using various charts and graphs, making it easier for users to stay within their budget.

## Key Features
- **Income and Expense Tracking**: Allows users to input and track their income and expenses over time.
- **Budget Category Breakdown**: Categorizes expenses (e.g., groceries, utilities, entertainment) for better visualization.
- **Visualization**: Displays financial trends using bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.
- **Monthly Comparison**: Compare current month spending with previous months to analyze spending patterns.
- **Goal Tracking**: Track savings and financial goals over time.

## Tech Stack
- **R**: For data manipulation, analysis, and dashboard creation.
- **shinydashboard**: For creating the interactive dashboard.
- **ggplot2**: For visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs).
- **dplyr**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **lubridate**: For handling date-related functions.
